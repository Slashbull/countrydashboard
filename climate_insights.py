    This dashboard reviews historical date crop quality yearâ€‘byâ€‘year based on simulated monthly climate data.
    
    **How It Works:**
    - We simulate monthly average climate data (average daily precipitation and maximum temperature) from 2012 to the current year.
    - For each year, we compute the average precipitation and average maximum temperature.
    - These averages are then used to assess the crop quality using a custom scoring function.
    - The results are displayed in a table and a bar chart.
